## CS-330 Final Project — 3D Scene

For this final project, I created a 3D scene in C++ using OpenGL to replicate a 2D reference image using simple geometric shapes. The goal was to build an accurate low-polygon scene while applying textures, lighting, and interactive camera controls.

Throughout the milestones, I refined the scene by adding textures, implementing Phong lighting, positioning objects in 3D space, and building navigation controls so the user can explore the scene from different angles.

### What This Scene Includes

• Multiple low-polygon objects built from basic shapes  
• One object created using multiple primitives  
• Texture mapping using high-resolution images  
• Phong lighting model (ambient, diffuse, specular)  
• Multiple light sources including a point light  
• Objects positioned using X, Y, Z coordinates

### Camera & Navigation Controls

The user can move freely through the scene:

• **W A S D** → move forward, back, left, right  
• **Q / E** → move up and down  
• **Mouse movement** → look around (pitch & yaw)  
• **Mouse scroll** → adjust movement speed  
• **P key** → toggle between perspective and orthographic view

### Development Notes

This project was built incrementally across milestones. I focused on keeping the geometry efficient, organizing functions for reuse, and placing lights so objects remain visible from multiple viewpoints.

Building the camera controls and lighting helped me better understand how users interact with 3D environments and how lighting affects realism.
